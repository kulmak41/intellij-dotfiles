This is a plugin that adds support of dotfiles to IntelliJ IDEA.

The dotfiles should be stored in ~/.idea

The dotfiles are stored in the JSON format.

The first dotfile is appearance.json

There you can specify your preferred editor font name, editor font size and application theme.
Standard theme names are "IntelliJ Light", "Darcula", "High contrast".

The second dotfile is keymap.json

There you can specify actions for keyboard shortcuts. Examples of shortcuts: "alt shift X", "control S".

Check examples in the dotfiles-examples directory for better understanding.

The plugin supports live reload.
